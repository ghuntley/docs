# Extending RavenDB

This section will describe various extensibility points available in RavenDB that were introduced to give the users the ability to enhance the capabilities and adjust many aspects of the server behavior to their own needs. 

We will start by describing all the [plugins](../../server/extending/plugins) and their roles and finally we will go through all available [bundles](../../server/extending/bundles).
