# Querying for terms

RavenDB lets you retrieve all terms indexed in a Lucene index for a specific field. Fields are usually your entity properties, but depending on how you built your indexes they may contain different information.

To get all unique values indexed for "MyProperty" in a specific index, with a page size of 128, use:

{CODE getterms1@ClientApi\Advanced\QueryingForTerms.cs /}

The third parameter is used for paging. Pass it the last term of the last page you got, and it will generate the next page for you.
