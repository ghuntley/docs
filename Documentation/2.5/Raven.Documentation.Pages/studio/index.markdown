# The Management Studio

The RavenDB Management Studio is a lightweight Silverlight client to let you easily manage the data in a RavenDB server instance. Using the Studio you can view, create, edit or delete documents, manage indexes, issue queries, view the errors log, import / export, and more.

The Studio is accessible from any RavenDB server, regardless of how it is deployed. However, it does require the user to authenticate against the server, most commonly using their Windows credentials.

## Basic navigation

At the top left of the page there are the navigation tabs, a link for each of the screens in the Studio:
