## How can I query for a null value?

Let us say that we want to find all users that didn't provide their email. This is the query that we will need to issue:

`
    Email:[[NULL_VALUE]]
`

The [[ ]] denotes and NotAnalyzed value, and Raven writes NULL_VALUE to the Lucene index when it encounters a null being indexed.
