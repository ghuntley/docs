# Using API Keys With RavenDB

Api keys are used when trying to authorize with OAuth.

Here are the steps needed in order to set the api keys:  

1) Open the browser  
2) Navigate to: http://localhost:{your server port}  
3) Go to the Databases section and select "System Database" on the top right

A few tips:  

- In order to set a key to all databases in the database name enter "*" (this will NOT grant access to the system database) 
- To grant access to the system database set the database name to "&lt;system&gt;".

Once all settings are entered give the user the "full api key" (you can right-click on it to copy).

In order to use this api key the user needs to set the api key when settings a new DocumentStore like this:
