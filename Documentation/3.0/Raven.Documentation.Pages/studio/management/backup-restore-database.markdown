# Manage Your Server : Backup & Restore Database

`Backup Database` is used to create a backup of a database. All you need to do is give the name of a database you want to backup, backup's location, and determine whether the backup should be incremental or not.

`Restore Database` is used to restore database backup. You need to provide a backup location and new database name. Additionally, you may give a path to a place where the data should end up (if you choose not to, a default path will be used) and carry out defragmentation.
