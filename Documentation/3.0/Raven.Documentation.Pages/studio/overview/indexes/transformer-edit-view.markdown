# Indexes : Transformers Edit View

This view allows adding new transformers or editing existing ones.

## Action Bar

Action Bar allows to perform the following functions:

- `Save` - saving transformers on the server,
- `Format` - reformatting and simplifying, if possible, transformer's function
- `Refresh` (__edit only__) - refreshing transformer's definition from the server
- `Delete` (__edit only__) - deleting transformers

{INFO Remember that changing the name of existing transformer creates a new one, **without** deleting the original. /}
