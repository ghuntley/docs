#Type-specific identifier generation

[In the previous article](./global), global key generation conventions were introduced. Any customization made by using those conventions changes the behavior for all stored entities.
Now we will show how to override the default ID generation in a more granular way, that is only for particular types of entities.

To override default document key generation algorithms you can register custom conventions per an entity type, where you can include your own identifier generation logic.


####RegisterIdConvention

{CODE:java register_id_convention_method@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.java /}

The conventions registered by this method are used for operations performed in a synchronous manner.


{INFO:Database name parameter}
The database name parameter is passed to the register convention methods to allow users to make Id generation decision per database 
(e.g. default document key generator - `MultiDatabaseHiloGenerator` - uses this parameter to prevent sharing HiLo values across the databases)
{INFO/}

{INFO:Database commands parameter}
Note that spectrum of identifier generation abilities is very wide because `IDatabaseCommands`  object is passed into an identifier convention function and can be used for an advanced calculation techniques.

###Example

Let's say that you want to use semantic identifiers for `Employee` objects. Instead of `employee/[identity]` you want to have keys like `employees/[lastName]/[firstName]`
(for the sake of simplicity, let us not consider the uniqueness of such keys). What you need to do is to create the convention that will combine the `employee` prefix, `LastName` and `FirstName` properties of an employee.

{CODE:java eployees_custom_convention@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.java /}

Now, when you store a new entity:

{CODE:java eployees_custom_convention_example@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.java /}

the client will associate the `employees/Bond/James` identifier with it.

##Inheritance

Registered conventions are inheritance-aware, so all types that can be assigned from registered type will fall into that convention according to inheritance-hierarchy tree.

###Example

If we create a new class `EmployeeManager` that will derive from our `Employee` class and keep the convention registered in the last example, then both types will use the following:

{CODE:java eployees_custom_convention_inheritance@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.java /}

If we register two conventions, one for `Employee` and the second for `EmployeeManager` then they will be picked for their specific types.

{CODE:java custom_convention_inheritance_2@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.java /}
