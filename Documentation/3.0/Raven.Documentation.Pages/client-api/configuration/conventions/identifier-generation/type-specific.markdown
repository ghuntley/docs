#Type-specific identifier generation

[In previous article](./global) global key generation conventions was introduced. Any customization made by using those conventions changes the behavior for all stored entities.
Now we will show how to override the default ID generation in a more granular way, that is only for particular types of entities.

To override default document key generation algorithms, you can register custom conventions per an entity type. You are able to include there own identifier generation logic.
There are two methods to satisfy that:

####RegisterIdConvention

{CODE register_id_convention_method@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.cs /}

The conventions registered by this medhod are used for operations performed in a synchronous manner.

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **func** | Func<string, IDatabaseCommands, TEntity, string> | Identifier generation function for given database name (`string`), commands object (`IDatabaseCommands`) and entity object (`TEntity`). |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| DocumentConvention | Current `DocumentConvention` instance. |

Type: DocumentConvention   
Current `DocumentConvention` instance.

####RegisterAsyncIdConvention

{CODE register_id_convention_method_async@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.cs /}

The conventions registered by this medhod are used for operations performed in an asynchronous manner.

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **func** | Func<string, IAsyncDatabaseCommands, TEntity, Task&lt;string&gt;> | Identifier generation function that supplies a result in async way for given database name (`string`), async commands object (`IAsyncDatabaseCommands`) and entity object (`TEntity`). |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| DocumentConvention | Current `DocumentConvention` instance. |

{INFO:Database name parameter}
The database name parameter is passed to the register convention methods to allow users to make Id generation decision per database 
(e.g. default document key generator - `MultiDatabaseHiloGenerator` - uses this parameter to prevent sharing HiLo values across the databases)
{INFO/}

{INFO:Database commands parameter}
Note that spectrum of identifier generation abilities is very wide, because `IDatabaseCommands` (or `IAsyncDatabaseCommands`) object is passed into an identifier convention function 
and can be used for an advanced calculation techniques.

###Example

Let's say that you want to use semantic identifiers for `Employee` objects. Instead of `employee/[identity]` you want to have keys like `employees/[lastName]/[firstName]`
(for simplicity let us not consider the uniqueness of such keys). What you need to do is to create the convention that will combine the `employee` prefix, `LastName` and `FirstName` 
properties of an employee.

{CODE eployees_custom_convention@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.cs /}

If you want to register your convention for async operations then use the second method:

{CODE eployees_custom_async_convention@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.cs /}

Now when you store a new entity:

{CODE eployees_custom_convention_example@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.cs /}

the client will associate with it `employees/Bond/James` identifier.

##Inheritance

Registered conventions are inheritance-aware, so all types that can be assigned from registered type will fall into that convention according to inheritance-hierarchy tree.

###Example

If we create a new class `EmployeeManager` that will derive from our `Employee` class and keep the convention registered in the last example, then both types will use it:

{CODE eployees_custom_convention_inheritance@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.cs /}

If we register two conventions, one for `Employee` and second for `EmployeeManager` then they will be picked for their specific types.

{CODE custom_convention_inheritance_2@ClientApi\Configuration\Conventions\IdentifierGeneration\TypeSpecific.cs /}
