# Session : How to enable optimistic concurrency?

By default, optimistic concurrency checks are turned **off**, which means that changes made outside our session object will be overwritten.
Checks can be turned on by setting `UseOptimisticConcurrency` property from `Advanced` session operations to `true` and may cause `ConcurrencyExceptions` to be thrown.
