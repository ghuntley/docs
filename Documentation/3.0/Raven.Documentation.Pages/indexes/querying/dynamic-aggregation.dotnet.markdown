# Dynamic aggregation

This feature is an another way to do aggregations and in contrast to [Map-Reduce](../../indexes/map-reduce-indexes) indexes, it allows to create much more complex queries. It gives you more options for reporting applications, dynamic selection and complex aggregation with additional filtering. 

When working with a map/reduce index we are able to do only limited amount of queries. Let's imagine a sample SQL query:

{CODE-BLOCK:csharp}
select sum(Total) from Orders where Total > 500 group by Product
{CODE-BLOCK/}

In order give you the ability to query like this, we introduced the dynamic aggregation feature. Thanks this you can build the following query:

{CODE dynamic_aggregation_1@Indexes\Querying\DynamicAggregation.cs /}

Assuming that your classes look like this:

{CODE currency@Indexes\Querying\DynamicAggregation.cs /}

{CODE order@Indexes\Querying\DynamicAggregation.cs /}

The _Orders/All_ index used in the query is a simple map-only index. The only difference is that you **have to** specify sort options for numeric fields used in the query. This is needed for recognizing by RavenDB types of numeric fields when such a query will come in.

{CODE dynamic_aggregation_index_def@Indexes\Querying\DynamicAggregation.cs /}

{WARNING Not specifying appropriate `SortOptions` for numerical fields will result in an **exception** when aggregation query is executed. /}

{NOTE Results of a dynamic aggregation query are calculated on the fly, while results of map/reduce index are precomputed. Most cases is fast enough but note that you can hit a lot of data. This feature should be used only for complex aggregate queries that cannot be done by using standard map/reduce. /}

## Extended faceted search

Under the covers this is [a faceted search](../../indexes/querying/faceted-search) with an extended support for doing aggregations. For example you can aggregate ranges:

{CODE dynamic_aggregation_range@Indexes\Querying\DynamicAggregation.cs /}

It also supports an aggregation on multiple levels:

{CODE dynamic_aggregation_multiple_items@Indexes\Querying\DynamicAggregation.cs /}

Another example is an aggregation on different fields based on same facet:

{CODE dynamic_aggregation_different_fieldss@Indexes\Querying\DynamicAggregation.cs /}

## Remarks

{WARNING `AggregateBy` only supports aggregation by single field, if you want to aggregate by a multiple fields you need to emit a single field that contains all values.   /}
