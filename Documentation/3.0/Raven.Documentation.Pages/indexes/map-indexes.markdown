# Map indexes

`Map` indexes (sometimes referred as simple indexes) contain one (or more) mapping functions that indicate which fields from documents should be indexed (in other words they indicate which documents can be searched by which fields). 

This **mapping functions** are a **LINQ-based functions** and can be considered index **core**.

## What can be indexed?

Easiest answer to this question is: practically anything. You can:

- [index single fields](../indexes/map-indexes#basics---indexing-single-fields)
- [combined multiple fields](../indexes/map-indexes#combining-multiple-fields-together) together
- [index partial field data](../indexes/map-indexes#indexing-partial-field-data)
- [index nested data](../indexes/map-indexes#indexing-nested-data)
- [index fields from related documents](../indexes/indexing-related-documents)
- [index fields from multiple collections](../indexes/indexing-polymorphic-data#multi-map-indexes)
- ...and so on. 

Various articles in this part of documentation will describe possibilities in detail.

## Basics - indexing single fields

For start, let us create an index that will help us to search for `Employees` by their `FirstName`, `LastName` (or both).

- first, let's start creating an index called `Employees/ByFirstAndLastName`

{CODE indexes_1@Indexes/Map.cs /}

You probably noticed that we're passing `Employee` as a generic parameter to `AbstractIndexCreationTask`, by doing this our indexing function will have a strongly-typed syntax. If you are not familiar with `AbstractIndexCreationTask` then you should read [this](../indexes/creating-and-deploying) article before proceeding.

- next step is to create a indexing function itself, to do it we need to set the `Map` property with our function in **parameterless constructor**.

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Query-syntax indexes_2@Indexes/Map.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Method-syntax indexes_3@Indexes/Map.cs /}
{CODE-TABS/}

- final step is to [deploy it](../indexes/creating-and-deploying) (omitted) to server and issue a query using session [Query](../client-api/session/querying/how-to-query) method:

{CODE indexes_4@Indexes/Map.cs /}
{CODE indexes_5@Indexes/Map.cs /}

Our final index looks like:

{CODE indexes_6@Indexes/Map.cs /}

{WARNING:Convention}

You will probably noticed in `Studio` that the function there is a bit different from that defined in `Employees_ByFirstAndLastName` class and look something like this:

{CODE-BLOCK:json}
from doc in docs.Employees
select new
{
	FirstName = doc.FirstName,
	LastName = doc.LastName
}
{CODE-BLOCK/}

The part you should pay attention to is `docs.Employees`. This syntax indicates from which collection server should take documents for indexing. In our case documents will be taken from `Employees` collection. To change the collection you need to change `Employees` to desired collection name or remove it and leave only `docs` to index **all documents**.

{WARNING/}

## Combining multiple fields together

Since under each index there is a LINQ-function, so you can combine multiple fields in one if necessary when document is being indexed is not a problem.

{CODE indexes_7@Indexes/Map.cs /}

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:Query indexes_8@Indexes/Map.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:DocumentQuery indexes_9@Indexes/Map.cs /}
{CODE-TABS/}

## Indexing partial field data

Imagine that you would like to return all employees that were born in specific year. You could of course do it by indexing `Birthday` from `Employee` in following way:

{CODE indexes_1_2@Indexes/Map.cs /}

{CODE indexes_1_3@Indexes/Map.cs /}

But, RavenDB gives you an ability to extract field data and index by it, so another way to achieve our goal would be to do as follows:

{CODE indexes_1_0@Indexes/Map.cs /}

{CODE indexes_1_1@Indexes/Map.cs /}

## Indexing nested data

If our document contains nested data, e.g. `Employee` contains `Address`. You can index by its fields by accessing them directly in index. Let's say that we would like to create an index that would return all employees that were born in specific `Country`:

{CODE indexes_1_4@Indexes/Map.cs /}

{CODE indexes_1_5@Indexes/Map.cs /}

If document relationship is represented by document Id, you can use `LoadDocument` method to retrieve such a document. More about it can be read [here](../indexes/indexing-related-documents).

## Indexing multiple collections

Please read our dedicated article about `Multi-Map` indexes that can be found [here](../indexes/indexing-polymorphic-data#multi-map-indexes).
