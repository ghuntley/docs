# Troubleshooting : Recording traffic using FiddlerCAP

When sending a support ticket, it is good to include as much information about the issue as you can, in particular a web traffic log may speed up the process on our side. To create such a log, we recommend using a [FiddlerCap](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddlercap) recorder which will create a SAZ file that we can analyze further.

## Step-by-step guide

1. [Download](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddlercap) FiddlerCap
2. Close all instances of Internet Explorer (or other browsers).
3. Run the FiddlerCapSetup.exe file.
4. FiddlerCap will start automatically when the installer completes.
5. Inside FiddlerCap press Clear Cookies button and then the Clear Cache button.
7. Inside FiddlerCap, click the **1. Start Capture** button.
8. Record web traffic using your application.
9. To add a screenshot to your capture, press the +Screenshot button inside FiddlerCap.
10. Inside FiddlerCap, click the **2. Stop Capture** button.
11. Click the **3. Save Capture** button. Save the .SAZ file to your desktop.
