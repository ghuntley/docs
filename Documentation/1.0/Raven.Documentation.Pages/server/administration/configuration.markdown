# Configuration options

All the configuration options detailed below are defined in the <appSettings> section of your config file as separate values. When running RavenDB as a website (through IIS, or in Embedded mode), the config file is web.config; otherwise it is the Raven.Server.exe.config file.

Changes to the config file or additions / removal from the Plugins directory will not be picked up automatically by the RavenDB service. For your changes to be recognized you will need to restart the service. You can do so calling: <code>Raven.Server.exe /restart</code>.

If you are running in Embedded mode, or RavenDB is running as an IIS application, touching the web.config file will cause IIS to automatically restart RavenDB.

## Sample configurations file

This is the standard app.config XML file. The `appSettings` section is where the configuration options go, also for web applications which have a web.config file instead.

* **Raven/TempIndexCleanupPeriod**  
    How often to run the temporary index cleanup process (in seconds)  
    _Default:_ 600 (10 minutes)  

* **Raven/TempIndexCleanupThreshold**  
    How much time in seconds to wait after a temporary index has been used before removing it if no further calls were made to it during that time  
    _Default:_ 1200 (20 minutes)  

* **Raven/TempIndexInMemoryMaxMB**  
    Temp indexes are kept in memory until they reach this integer value in MB  
    _Default:_ 25 MB  
    _Minimum:_ 1 MB

## Data settings:

* **Raven/RunInMemory**

    _Allowed values:_ true/false  
    _Default:_ false  

* **Raven/DataDir**  
    The directory for the RavenDB database. You can use the ~\ prefix to refer to RavenDB's base directory.
