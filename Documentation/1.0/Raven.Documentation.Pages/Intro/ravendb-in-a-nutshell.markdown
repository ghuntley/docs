# RavenDB in a nutshell

RavenDB is a **transactional**, **open-source** [Document Database](what-is-a-document-database) written in **.NET**, offering a **flexible data model** designed to address requirements coming from real-world systems. RavenDB allows you to build high-performance, low-latency applications quickly and efficiently.

Data in RavenDB is stored **schema-less** as JSON documents, and can be queried efficiently using **Linq** queries from .NET code or using **RESTful** API using other tools. Internally, RavenDB make use of indexes which are automatically created based on your usage, or were created explicitly by the consumer.

RavenDB is built for **web-scale**, and is offering **replication** and **sharding** support out-of-the-box.

There's a whole lot more of exciting features - check [RavenDB's features page](http://ravendb.net/features).

## Using RavenDB

RavenDB consists of a server and a client. The server handles data storage and queries, and the client is what a consumer uses to communicate with the server. There is more than one way to deploy RavenDB in your project:

* Server service on a Windows based machine
* Integrated with IIS
* Embedded client - embeds a RavenDB instance in your .NET application, web or desktop.

After you have a RavenDB server instance up and running, its easy to connect to it using the RavenDB client to store and retrieve your data. RavenDB works with your [POCO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_CLR_Object)s, meaning its super-easy to integrate it with your existing or newly-built application:

{CODE nutshell1@Intro\Nutshell.cs /}

As you may have noticed, RavenDB is using the [Unit of Work pattern](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html), so all changes made before calling session.SaveChanges() will be persisted in the database in a single transaction.

## Development cycle

There are two flavors of RavenDB available - the stable build, which is production ready, and the unstable build. Since we at Hibernating Rhinos make a public build out of every push, the unstable build is **not** recommended for production, although it is thoroughly tested before being made available.

New unstable builds are available daily, and sometimes more than once a day. Stable builds are released when we feel comfortable enough with recent changes we made - usually when enough time has passed and a handful of people have used the unstable builds. This is usually done on a biweekly basis.

Only stable builds are supported for production use. 

## Reporting bugs

Bugs should be reported in the mailing list: [http://groups.google.com/group/ravendb](http://groups.google.com/group/ravendb).

When reporting a bug, please include:

* The version and build of Raven that you used (can be the build number, or the git commit hash).
* What did you try to do?
* What happened?
* What did you expect to happen?
* Details about your environment.
* Details about how to reproduce this error.

*Bugs that comes with a way for us to reproduce the program locally (preferably a unit test) are usually fixed much more quickly.*

## Licensing and support

RavenDB is released as open-source under the AGPL license. What that means is it is freely available, but if you want to use this with proprietary software, you **must** buy a [commercial license](http://ravendb.net/licensing).

RavenDB has a very active [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ravendb), where users and RavenDB developers attend all queries quickly and efficiently.
