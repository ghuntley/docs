# Intro to RavenDB

The intro section is all about being an entry gate to RavenDB and the documentation. It will include short discussions on general topics like "What is NoSQL" and "What is a Document Database", basic technical pages like "System requirements" and some discussion on features.

Basic Quickstart tutorials will be here as well.

More in-depth theory on NoSQL, Document Databases and RavenDB are in the [Theory chapter](../theory).
