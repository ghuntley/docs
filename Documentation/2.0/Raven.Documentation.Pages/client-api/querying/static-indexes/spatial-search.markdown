#Spatial Search

To support the ability to retrieve the data based on spatial coordinates, the spatial search have been introduced.

##Creating Indexes

To take an advantage of spatial search, first we need to create an index with spatial field. To mark field as a spatial field, we need to use `SpatialGenerate` method

{CODE spatial_search_0@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

{CODE spatial_search_6@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

where:   

*	**fieldName** is a name of the field containing the shape to use for filtering (if the overload with no `fieldName` is used, then the name is set to default value: `__spatial`)          
*	**lat/lng** are latitude/longitude coordinates   
*	**shapeWKT** is a shape in [WKT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) format    
*	**strategy** is a spatial search strategy (default: `GeohashPrefixTree`)
*	**maxTreeLevel** is a integer that indicates the maximum number of levels to be used in `PrefixTree` and controls the precision of shape representation (**9** for `GeohashPrefixTree` and **23** for `QuadPrefixTree`)      

In our example we will use `Event` class and very simple index defined below.

{CODE spatial_search_1@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

{CODE spatial_search_2@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

##Spatial search strategies

1. GeohashPrefixTree

Geohash is a latitude/longitude representation system that describes earth as a grid with 32 cells, assigning to each grid cell an alphanumeric character. Each grid cell is divided further into 32 smaller chunks and each chunk has also an alphanumeric character assigned and so on.

E.g. The location of a 'New York' in United States is represented by following geohash: [DR5REGY6R](http://geohash.org/dr5regy6r) and it represents the `40.7144 -74.0060` coordinates. Removing characters from the end of geohash will decrease the precision level.

More information about geohash uses, decoding algorithm and limitations can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash).

2. QuadPrefixTree

QuadTree represents earth as a grid with exactly four cells and similarly to geohash, each grid cell (sometimes called bucket) has a letter assigned and is divided further into 4 more cells and so on.

More information about QuadTree can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

{NOTE `GeohashPrefixTree` is a default `SpatialSearchStrategy`. Doing any changes to the strategy after index has been created will trigger re-indexation process. /}

###Precision

By default the precision level (`maxTreeLevel`) for GeohashPrefixTree is set to **9** and for QuadPrefixTree the value is **23**, which means that the coordinates are represented by a 9 or 23 character string. The difference exists, because the `QuadTree` representation would be much less precise if the level would be the same.

##Radius search

The most basic usage and probably most common one is to search for all points or shapes within provided distance from the given center point. To perform this search we will use `WithinRadiusOf` method that is a part of query customizations.

{CODE spatial_search_3@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

The method can be used also when using `LuceneQuery`.

{CODE spatial_search_8@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

##Advanced search

The `WithinRadiusOf` method is a wrapper around `RelatesToShape` method.

{CODE spatial_search_5@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

{CODE spatial_search_7@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

where first parameter is a name of the field containing the shape to use for filtering, next one is a shape in [WKT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) format and the last one is a spatial relation type.

So to perform a radius search from the above example and use `RelatesToShape` method, we do as follows

{CODE spatial_search_4@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

or when we want to use `LuceneQuery` then

{CODE spatial_search_9@ClientApi/Querying/StaticIndexes/SpatialSearch.cs /}

{WARNING From RavenDB 2.0 the distance is measured in **kilometers** in contrast to the miles used in previous versions. /}
