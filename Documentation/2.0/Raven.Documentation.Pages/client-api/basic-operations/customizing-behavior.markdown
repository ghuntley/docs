#Customizing the Behavior of the Client API
The RavenDB .NET Client API includes the following classes (interfaces):

- <em>IDocumentStore</em>
- <em>IDocumentSession</em>

After creating a document store as an instance of the `DocumentStore` class and opening a session (an instance of `IDocumentSession`) from the document store created, we need to access the properties of the `DocumentConvention` object in order customize the behavior of the RavenDB Client API.

##DocumentConvention Properties
The `DocumentConvention` class includes the following properties, which users can use to modify the behavior of the RavenDB Client API:

- <em>ApplyReduceFunction</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by an internally defined `ApplyReduceFunctionFunc` delegate. The method is called to obtain reduce results and to ensure that the reduce function is run over the merged results in a sharded environment. The default method is `DefaultApplyReduceFunction`.
- <em>CustomizeJsonSerializer</em>. Gets or sets the name of the `JsonSerializer` object whose methods are referenced by an `Action` delegate. The `JsonSerializer` object has a method that serializes objects into the JSON format, a method that deserializes objects from it, and, in particular, a method that obtains reduce results for anonymous objects. These methods define how objects are encoded into JSON.
- <em>DefaultQueryingConsistency</em>. Gets or sets a value from the `ConsistencyOptions` enumeration, which defines consistency options for all queries. The default value is `MonotonicRead`, which ensures that older values from querying an index will not be seen after a newer value has been obtained.
- <em>DisableProfiling</em>. Gets or sets a Boolean value that indicates whether all profiling support will be disabled. The default value is `true`. 
- <em>DocumentKeyGenerator</em> and <em>AsyncDocumentKeyGenerator</em>. Gets or sets the document key generator (returned by `GenerateDocumentKey`).
- <em>EnlistInDistributedTransactions</em>. Gets or sets a Boolean value that indicates whether RavenDB will automatically enlist in distributed transactions. The default value is `true`.
- <em>FailoverBehavior</em>. Gets a value from the  `FailoverBehavior` enumeration, which defines options for handling failover in a replicated environment when the primary server cannot be reached. The default value is `AllowReadsFromSecondaries`, which allows reading from secondary servers, but immediately fails writing to them.
- <em>FindClrType</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate for finding the CLR type of a document. The name of the default method is specified by an internal constant.
- <em>FindClrTypeName</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate for finding the CLR type name that will be stored in the document metadata from the CLR type. The default method is set internally and depends on the browsing environment.
- <em>FindFullDocumentKeyFromNonStringIdentifier</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate for finding the full document key from a non-string identifier. The default method is `DefaultFindFullDocumentKeyFromNonStringIdentifier`, which finds the full document name assuming that the standard conventions are used to generate the document key.
- <em>FindIdentityProperty</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate for finding the identity property. The default method is defined internally.
- <em>FindIdentityPropertyNameFromEntityName</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate for finding the identity property name from the entity name. The default method is defined internally.
- <em>FindIdValuePartForValueTypeConversion</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate  for converting a string identifier into a value type, such as an integer or a GUID. The default method is defined internally.
- <em>FindPropertyNameForDynamicIndex</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate for finding the property name from the indexed document type, the indexed name, the current path, and the property.
- <em>FindPropertyNameForIndex</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate for finding the property name from the indexed document type, the indexed name, the current path, and the property path. The default method is defined internally.
- <em>FindTypeTagName</em>. Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate for finding the tag name for the specified type. The default method is `DefaultTypeTagName`, which gives the default tag name for the specified type.
- <em>IdentityPartsSeparator</em>. Gets or sets the  separator between identity parts that is used by the HiLo generators. The default separator is the slash (/).
- <em>IdentityTypeConvertors</em>. Gets or sets a list of the type converters that can be used to translate the document key (string) to the type that is used on the entity if the type is not already a string. The default list consists of `GuidConverter()`, `Int32Converter()`, and `Int64Converter()`.
- <em>JsonContractResolver</em>. Gets or sets a reference to a `ContractResolver` object, which defines the JSON contract resolver.
- <em>MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession</em>. The maximum number of requests that can be handled during a single session. The default value is 30.
- <em>ShouldCacheRequest</em>. Gets or sets a Boolean value that indicates whether RavenDB should cache a request to a specified URL. The default value is `true`.
- <em>TransformTypeTagNameToDocumentKeyPrefix</em>. 
Gets or sets the name of the method referenced by a `Func` delegate for translating a type tag name to a document key prefix. The default method is `DefaultTransformTypeTagNameToDocumentKeyPrefix`.
- <em>UseParallelMultiGet</em>. Gets or sets a Boolean value that indicates whether RavenDB should use parallel multi-get processing. The default value is `true`. 

The default values of most of these properties are set internally by the <code>DocumentConvention</code> constructor.
